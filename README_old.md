# Calder Vale Railway Real Ale Trail

This page will be an alternative to the [Transpennine Real Ale Trail] (http://www.realaletrail.net/).

It is a rough guide, a work in progress, based on the Halifax to Manchester branch of the [Calder Valley Railway Line] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calder_Valley_line).

This page will eventually be a full guide to the pubs serving real ale that can be found on the Western end of the Calder Valley Railway Line, on the leg from Halifax to Manchester Victoria.

The idea came to a group of colleagues and fellow real ale enthusiasts after having had an enjoyable day out on the original and first [Transpennine Real Ale Trail] (http://www.realaletrail.net) made famous by Oz and James.

- Mytholmroyd
- Hebden Bridge
- Todmorden
- Walsden
- Littleborough
- Smithy Bridge
- Rochdale
- Castleton
- Mills Hill
- Moston
- Manchester Victoria

Eventually every stop on the trail will have its own page with dirctions, a map, contact details etc. And maybe we can even produce a .pdf or printable guide for those 'old school' types who don't want to be consulting their mobile every ten minutes.

Collaboration is welcome, especially from someone who can port the Adobe Spark page into our 'own' HTML page.
