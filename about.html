					<h1>About the Calder Valley Railway Ale Trail</h1>
					<h2>This is an alternative to the <a href="http://www.realaletrail.net/">Transpennine Real Ale Trail</a>. It is a rough guide, a work in progress, based on the Halifax to Manchester branch of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calder_Valley_line">Calder Valley Railway Line</a>.</h2>
						<p>The Calder Valley Railway Line was formerly known as the Caldervale Line - which is where the web address <a href="www.calder-vale-ale.uk">www.calder-vale-ale.uk</a> is taken from).</p>
					<hr>
					<p>This page will eventually be a full guide to the pubs serving real ale that can be found on the Western end of the Calder Valley Railway Line, on the leg from Halifax to Manchester Victoria.</p>
					<p>The idea came to a group of colleagues and fellow real ale enthusiasts after having had an enjoyable day out on the original and first <a href="http://www.realaletrail.net/">Transpennine Real Ale Trail</a> made famous by Oz and James. We had a cracking day, but it was busy at times. An additional factor was that another colleague had opened his own bar in Castleton, Rochdale and this is a short walk from the station. We wondered if we could put together a similar railway based real ale trail that included our friend's bar. We did a bit of looking at the timetables and arranged a recce on the 25 Feb 2017.</p>
					<p>It was only when we came to put this page together that we found several other people had had the same idea:
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://foursquare.com/nrturner/list/calder-valley-rail-ale-trail">Not an original idea - Neil Turner got here first!</a></li>
              <li><a   href="http://chrisdyson55.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/real-ale-in-calder-valley.html">Then Chris Dyson did a blogspot</a></li>
							<li><a   href="https://be803fe5c416e39d38ae-aa21086260d3bd4e072d597fe09c2e80.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/images/timetables/2016-11/route-timetables/Northern36web1216.pdf" rel="nofollow">You will need to get hold of a timetable for Northern Rail Route 36</a>
              </li>
						</ul>

						<p>There are some trains from Halifax that don&#39;t stop at Sowerby Bridge or Mytholmroyd, but once you get past about 12 O&#39;clock there are trains approximately every half hour.</p>
            <p>A list of all the stations on the route follows (on this first outing we started at Sowerby Bridge and travelled towards Manchester, picking a few stops that looked interesting to start with. You can choose your own stops, or you can do this in the opposite direction its up to you!)...</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Halifax</li>
							<li>Sowerby Bridge</li>
							<li>Mytholmroyd</li>
							<li>Hebden Bridge</li>
							<li>Todmorden</li>
							<li>Walsden</li>
							<li>Littleborough</li>
							<li>Smithy Bridge</li>
							<li>Rochdale</li>
							<li>Castleton</li>
							<li>Mills Hill</li>
							<li>Moston</li>
							<li>Manchester Victoria</li>
						</ul>
						<p> Eventually each town/station will have its own page with directions and a map to the pubs. Possibly we'll have a little .pdf sheet that you can print out to take with you (just in case you are 'old school' or your mobile runs out of battery or loses signal!)</p>
						<p>A Google Map shows the route...</p>
